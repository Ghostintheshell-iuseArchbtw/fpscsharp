# Unity FPS Game Project

This is a Unity-based first-person shooter game project. When suggesting code, please consider:

- Use Unity's built-in physics system for realistic movement and collisions
- Follow Unity best practices for performance optimization
- Use the new Input System package for player controls
- Implement object pooling for frequently spawned objects like bullets
- Use ScriptableObjects for weapon and enemy data
- Follow component-based architecture
- Use Unity's animation system for character movements
- Implement proper shader-based effects for realistic visuals
- make it very realistic like rust or escape from tarkov.
