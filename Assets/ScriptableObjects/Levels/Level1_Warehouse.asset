  BriefingText: "Intel reports suggest the stolen prototype is being held in an abandoned
    warehouse on the outskirts of the city. Your mission is to infiltrate the facility,
    locate the prototype, and extract it safely. The warehouse is guarded by hostile
    forces, so stealth is recommended but not required.\n\nAdditional intel suggests
    that the enemy commander may be on site. Taking him out would deal a significant
    blow to their operations."
