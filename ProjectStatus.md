### Asset Structure
- ✅ Organized folder structure for assets
- ✅ Shader setup for weapon and environmental effects
- ✅ Input system configuration
- ✅ Automated setup scripts (`setup_and_build.sh`, `setup_and_build.bat`) for easier project initialization.

## Setup Guide (To Make It Work)

**It is highly recommended to use the automated setup scripts first:**
- For Linux/macOS: `sh setup_and_build.sh`
- For Windows: `setup_and_build.bat`

These scripts will guide you through initial Unity installation checks, create necessary folders, generate placeholder files for prefabs, create a default `game_config.json`, and produce a `SETUP_INSTRUCTIONS.md` file with more detailed in-Unity steps.

The guide below summarizes the manual steps, many of which are covered by the scripts or detailed in the generated `SETUP_INSTRUCTIONS.md`.

### 1. Required Resources
- Download and import Standard Assets for:
  - First Person Character Controller
  - Effects
  - Environment
  - ParticleSystems
  - Prototyping

### 2. Create Prefabs
Create the following prefabs in the Assets/Prefabs folder:
- DroppedWeapon.prefab (using DroppedWeapon.cs)
- DroppedConsumable.prefab (using ConsumableItem.cs)
- Checkpoint.prefab (using Checkpoint.cs)
- BulletImpact.prefab (for projectile impacts)
- MeleeSwingEffect.prefab (for melee weapons)

### 3. Create Required ScriptableObjects
- Create several WeaponData ScriptableObjects:
  - At least one of each weapon type (Pistol, AssaultRifle, Shotgun, SniperRifle, SMG, Melee)
- Create EnemyData ScriptableObjects:
  - At least a basic enemy and a more advanced enemy

### 4. Setup Main Scene
1. Create a new scene
2. Add a Player GameObject with:
   - PlayerController.cs
   - PlayerHealth.cs
   - PlayerInventory.cs
   - InteractionSystem.cs
   - SurvivalSystem.cs
   - WeaponManager.cs
3. Add a GameManager GameObject with:
   - GameManager.cs
   - ObjectPool.cs
   - LevelManager.cs
   - DamageHandler.cs
   - UIManager.cs
4. Add a UI Canvas with elements for:
   - Health/Armor
   - Hunger/Thirst
   - Temperature
   - Radiation
   - Stamina
   - Inventory
   - Crafting
   - Objective markers

### 5. Setup ObjectPool
Configure the ObjectPool with:
- Projectiles
- Impact effects
- Particle systems
- Blood effects
- UI notifications

### 6. Configuration Steps
1. Ensure Input System package is installed through Package Manager.
2. Setup `FPSInputActions.inputactions` mapping.
3. Configure initial weapons and items (ScriptableObjects in `Assets/ScriptableObjects`).
4. Setup checkpoints in the level (using `Checkpoint.prefab`).
5. Configure enemy spawn points and link to `EnemyData` ScriptableObjects.
6. Setup crafting recipes in `Assets/Resources/game_config.json` (the setup script creates a sample).
7. Review and follow the detailed steps in `SETUP_INSTRUCTIONS.md` generated by the setup scripts.

## Next Steps

### Core Gameplay
1. Create a main menu scene
2. Design and implement at least 3 levels with increasing difficulty
3. Create more weapon variations using the weapon system
4. Create more enemy types using the enemy system
5. Implement a progression system (unlocking weapons, abilities)
6. Add collectibles and secrets to levels
7. Design and implement storage containers (like Rust)
8. Create more crafting recipes and item types
9. Implement base building mechanics

### Visual and Audio
1. Create or obtain 3D models for weapons, enemies, and environments
2. Create or obtain animation sets for player and enemies
3. Record or obtain sound effects for weapons, environments, and UI
4. Create particle effects for weapon impacts, explosions, etc.
5. Design and implement UI elements (HUD, menus, inventory)
6. Design and create survival UI elements (hunger, thirst, temperature)
7. Create inventory and crafting UI screens

### Performance and Polish
1. Implement level-of-detail (LOD) systems for environments
2. Set up occlusion culling for large environments
3. Optimize shaders for different quality settings
4. Implement quality settings menu
5. Add controller support and input remapping
6. Implement accessibility options

### Testing and Balancing
1. Test and balance weapon damage, fire rates, and recoil
2. Test and balance enemy health, damage, and AI behaviors
3. Test level progression and difficulty curve
4. Optimize performance across different hardware configurations
5. Fix any bugs or issues

## Implementation Priority
1. Create basic level designs with placeholder assets
2. Implement main menu and game flow
3. Test core gameplay loop with placeholder assets
4. Add visual and audio assets
5. Polish and optimize
6. Final testing and balancing

## Resources Needed
- 3D Models: Weapons, enemies, environments, props
- Textures: Materials for all models
- Audio: Weapon sounds, footsteps, ambient sounds, music
